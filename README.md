# Introduction

CageLab is a low cost in-cage touchscreen training device that prioritises the following features:

1. **Customisable**: The device should be customisable to suit different facility needs. We employ a modular design using [T-slot framing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-slot_structural_framing) <picture src="images/tslot.png"></picture> for the shell to allow for easy modification without needing a full workshop.
1. **Scaleable**: We are integrating the Alyx metadata pipeline ([International Brain Lab, 2023, Nature Methods](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-022-01742-6)) to allow for easy management of the data generated by multiple CageLab instances. Each device uploads behavioural data to a central server, which can be accessed and searched by the user through a web interface.
1. **Automatic Training**: We use behavioural shaping and an automated staircase to guide subjects to improved behavioural performance.
1. **Low Cost**: The device should be affordable for most research labs. We aim to keep the total cost of the device below $400.
1. **Battery Operated**: Many animal facilities do not have power outlets in the animal rooms. The device should be battery operated. We use a small UPS to enable hot-swapping of batteries.
1. **Open Source**: The device software should be open source and easy to contribute to.
1. **Easy to Use**: The device should be easy to use and maintain; we chose PsychToolbox for easy integration with existing code common in most labs where PTB is dominant.
1. **Modular**: We have the following modules to use with the device:
	i. **Fluid Pump**: Peristaltic pump, HID interface and costs about $10.
	i. **Food Dispenser**: A pellet dispenser.
	i. **Camera**: A camera to record the animal's behaviour and stream it over the network.
	i. **Speaker**: A speaker to play sounds.
1. **Remote Control**: The device should be controllable remotely.
