# Hardware

The hardware modules are designed to be modular and easy to assemble. We use T-slot aluminium framing for the shell to allow for easy modification without needing a full workshop. Both the fluid pump and joystick have a HID interface, allowing them to be used with any computer. The food dispenser is designed to be easy to clean and refill.
