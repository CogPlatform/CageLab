# Software Frameworks

We use the opticka toolbox for the main experiment control, a high-level wrapper for PsychToolbox. 


## Data pipeline

We use the [International Brain Lab](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-022-01742-6) metadata pipeline to manage the data generated by CageLab instances, which opticka supports without other dependencies. 




## Remote control

We use SSH and the [moonlight remote desktop protocol](https://moonlight-stream.org) for remote control of the device.
