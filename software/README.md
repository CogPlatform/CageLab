# Software Frameworks

We use opticka for the main experiment control, a wrapper for PsychToolbox for the stimulus presentation. We use the [International Brain Lab](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-022-01742-6) metadata pipeline to manage the data generated by CageLab instances, which opticka supports without other dependencies. We use the [moonlight remote desktop protocol](https://moonlight-stream.org) for remote control of the device.
