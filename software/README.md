# Software Frameworks

We use the opticka toolbox for the main experiment control, a high-level wrapper for PsychToolbox. A GUI called `CageLab.mlapp` is provided. This GUI is run on your lab machine and will send the experiment settings to the CageLab instance. Each experiment protocol can be run.

## Data pipeline

We use the [International Brain Lab](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-022-01742-6) metadata pipeline to manage the data generated by CageLab instances, which opticka supports without other dependencies. 


## Remote control

We use Zerotier VPN, SSH and the [moonlight remote desktop protocol](https://moonlight-stream.org) or NoMachine for remote control of the device.
